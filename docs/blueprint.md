# **App Name**: CircuitCheck

## Core Features:

- Component Drag-and-Drop: Enables users to drag components from a library onto the canvas, and arrange them with pan, zoom, and snap-to-grid functionalities.
- Configurable Component Properties: Allows the adjustment of component properties, such as voltage range, current range, and logic type via an interactable properties panel.
- Automated Circuit Validation: A tool automatically reads component datasets and checker inputs to validate the circuits against predefined specifications.
- AI-Assisted Issue Resolution: Suggests potential solutions to circuit validation failures using AI reasoning.
- Checker Component Library: Offers a range of checker components that facilitate the validation of circuit elements. Supported types: voltage, current, logic, rise/fall time, pulse width, connectivity, and user-defined custom rules.
- Connection Visualization: Allows users to make logical/electrical links between pins by allowing components to be connected visually using connection wires.
- Dataset Viewer: Enable users to examine the underlying dataset of the components used via the use of an info panel. Enables adjustment of editable fields.
- Visual Result Feedback: Provides visual feedback for each validation by dynamically changing wire colors to reflect pass/fail status, instantly showing pin-level report information.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Medium electric blue (#7DF9FF) to suggest engineering precision with creativity.
- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#E0F4F7).
- Accent color: Light purple (#BEADFA), to clearly demarcate key UI elements while retaining an element of cohesion with the other colors.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', sans-serif, for a modern, machined, objective feel
- Use simplified, geometric icons for circuit components and checker types.
- Maintain a clear hierarchical layout with a component library sidebar, a canvas workspace, and a properties panel.
- Implement subtle animations to signal state changes and guide user interaction.
